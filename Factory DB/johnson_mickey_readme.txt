 * Mickey Johnson
 * Final DB project

TO RUN THE JAVA APPLET:

1) Open MySQL workbench. You will need your usename 
and the address of the server to open the program.
The program will automatically set the server to localhost:3306
so if this is the address of your server then don't worry about it.

2) Load and run the johnson_mickey_backend.sql file.
This will create the database, tables, 
and load up some values into the database.

3) Run the Johnson_Mickey_DBAPP.jar file.

4) Enter the following:
Server address: This is the address of your local server
the format should be "server:port/dbname".
This field defaults to localhost:3306/johnson_mickey_db, which
if you haven't changed your address, ports, on the database name should work.

Username: This is the username you use to connet to your database.
It is displayed at the MySQL workbench start screen.

Password: This is the password for your server.

5) Press login.

You should now be in the program.
